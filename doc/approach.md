# Approach

The following scheme depicts the approach:

![](global_approach.png)

The blue circles are the input of our approach: $v_1$, the version of the program before the commit, the commit, $v_2$ the version of the program after applying the commit and the tests.
The purple circles are the output of our approach: the selected tests, the instrumented tests, the consumption of each on both version $v_1$ and $v_2$, the delta test-wise ($\Delta(t)$) and the decision: :x: is breaking the build and :heavy_check_mark: is passing the build.
Each step of your approach is represented by a hexagon.
The orange hexagons are the parts that is language-agnostic, and therefore handled by **Diff-XJoules**.
The red hexagons, and the red rectangle, are the language-specific parts.

## Diff-XJoules Steps

:construction:

# Language-specific parts

In the **Diff-XJoules**, there are 3 language-specific parts:

1. [The computation of the code coverage](https://github.com/davidson-consulting/diff-xjoules/tree/main/doc/coverage.md)
2. [The instrumentation of the tests](https://github.com/davidson-consulting/diff-xjoules/tree/main/doc/instrumentation.md)
3. [The execution of the tests](https://github.com/davidson-consulting/diff-xjoules/tree/main/doc/execution.md)
