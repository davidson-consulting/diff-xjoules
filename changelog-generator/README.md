# Changelog Generator

This program generates changelog of your program from commits in a markdown format. This is convenient to build a changelog for your releases.

For a more generic version, please refer to [danglotb/changelog-generator](https://gitlab.com/danglotb/changelog-generator).

## Credits

The original author is [Thomas Durieux](https://durieux.me), and was developped for generating dedicated changelogs for [Spoon](https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/tree/8604b4bb86fd080915edd4cb9dc44d0866f3d59b/doc/_release/changelog_generator).

I did some modifications to support be run easily on `davidson-consulting/diff-xjoules`.
